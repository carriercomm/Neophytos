    REMOVED BY KMCGUIRE
    I LEFT THIS HERE FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES, BUT THIS CODE IS NOT USED ANYMORE.

    It mainly setup some entry points for Python but it uses the python headers,
    and it was possible to load this library just fine with out using anything
    python specific so the only dependancies now are a crypto library that provides
    the AES-CTR-256 functions, and the standard C library.

    On linux you can link with -lcrypto to provide the AES-CTR-256 functions, and
    on Windows.. well I have not got there yet to producing a DLL. Will update when
    I do.
