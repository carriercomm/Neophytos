    This provides a console like interface to the remote server.

    The support commands are:

    cd <directory>                  change directory
    ls <directory>                  list directory
    rm <path>                       remove file
    rmd <path>                      remove directory
    up <lpath> <rpath>              upload file
    down <rpath> <lpath>            download file

    This is a good tool to inspect your remote storage and to make
    changes that would be very difficult and tedious to do with the
    normal backup utility.
